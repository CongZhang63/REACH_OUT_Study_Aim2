Instructions for running the R scripts

- create a work directory
Put the 5 scripts there.

- create the subdirectories "tables", "images", "fichiers".
Place your datafile in "tables".
"images" and "fichiers" will respectively receive the generated graphics and output files.
(They must have the necessary rights for being written in).

- in both "run" scripts paste the absolute path to your work directory in the setwd() command.

- run the scripts with R software.
